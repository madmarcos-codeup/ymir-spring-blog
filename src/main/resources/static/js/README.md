from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/webpack.html
and https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/using-webpack-and-the-aws-sdk-for-javascript-to-create-and-bundle-an-application-part-1/

run `npm run build`

copy resulting `bundle.js` to `resources/static/js`


NOTE: I am not using aws-sdk v3 because I hate webpack
I will use v2 for now
